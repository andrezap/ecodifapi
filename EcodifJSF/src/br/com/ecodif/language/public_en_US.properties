mainPageAboutEcoDiF=EcoDiF is a Web platform for connecting devices and products with applications and/or end-users in order to provide control, visualization, processing, and data storage functionalities. By working as the core of an Internet of Things ecosystem, it offers (software) services focused on: (i) the connectivity of devices to the Internet; (ii) application services, and; (iii) support services. EcoDiF can be used in several contexts, such as environmental monitoring, infrastructure monitoring and traffic and road conditions monitoring, as well as for sharing sensing devices among academic laboratories.

documentationAboutEcoDiF=EcoDiF is a Web-based platform for connecting devices with applications and/or end-users in an Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, thus allowing that new ideas and products are developed in an organic way. The main goal of EcoDiF is to integrate heterogeneous physical devices in order to provide services for supporting real-time data control, visualization, processing and storage. The EcoDiF design and implementation are fully based on design patterns and several well-known Web technologies (such as HTTP, REST, EEML and EMML), thus standardizing and simplifying the development of applications and eliminating compatibility issues between different manufacturers, proprietary protocols, and data formats.
documentationDevicesConnectionModule=The <strong>Devices Connection Module</strong> aims to facilitate the connection of physical devices to the IoT. Device manufacturers configure their devices according to the EcoDiF's specific API to enable their integration with the platform, and then other users connect their pre-configured devices to perform the operations of the provided API. Such devices are connected to EcoDiF through customized <strong>drivers</strong> developed for each specific type of device. These drivers play a very important role in terms of the integration of the devices with EcoDiF since the heterogeneity of such devices is abstracted away from the users and applications that make use of the data provided by them.
documentationDriversDataManipulationModule=In EcoDiF, there are two types of drivers, namely <strong>active</strong> and <strong>passive</strong> drivers. The active drivers obtain the data collected by the devices by making periodical requests to the device's API even if the collected data values remain unchanged. On the other hand, passive (or event-driven) drivers wait for notifications from the device's API, triggered whenever there are changes in the data values. After obtaining data from the devices (the so-called <strong>feeds</strong>), the drivers structure them by using the <a href="http://eeml.org/">Extended Environments Markup Language (EEML)</a>, which is a language for describing the data obtained from devices in a specific context (environment). Finally, such structured data are sent to EcoDiF through HTTP PUT requests in order to be registered at the platform by the <strong>Data Manipulation Module</strong>.
documentationVisualizationManagementModule=The <strong>Visualization and Management Module</strong> provides a Web interface to enable users to manage the devices connected to EcoDiF. Through such interface, users can monitor the state and the localization of their devices and visualize historical data stored in the platform. Moreover, users can create <strong>triggers</strong>, which are event-based mechanisms that enable to notify users based on constraints defined by them in terms of the current values for the feeds. For instance, consider a feed associated with the monitoring of temperature in a given environment. In this case, the user can create a trigger to notify him/her whenever the measured temperature is greater than 40 degrees Celsius.
documentationCollaborationModule=The <strong>Collaboration Module</strong> aims to facilitate the collaboration among EcoDiF users, thus enabling them to perform searches for devices and applications from their respective metadata (type, user, localization, etc.) through the EcoDiF's Web interface.
documentationStorageModule=The <strong>Storage Module</strong> consists of two basic repositories: (i) a repository for storing data by using a relational database, and; (ii) a repository for storing application scripts in a file system. These repositories may use a Cloud Computing infrastructure to store relational data and files, thus providing quality attributes such as robustness, reliability, security, availability, and scalability.
documentationCommonServicesModule=The <strong>Common Services Module</strong> encompasses infrastructure services offered by the platform, such as security (in terms of user authenticity, confidentiality, and integrity), applications life cycle management, transactions, etc.
documentationApplicationsModule=The <strong>Applications Module</strong> provides a model and environment for programming and executing applications that makes use of the data (feeds) available at EcoDiF and generates new, value-added information to be provided by the platform. In EcoDiF, these applications are built as Web mashups, which are ad-hoc Web applications created from the composition of different types of information provided by several sources, such as Web services and relational databases. For instance, a sensor monitors the temperature in a given location, but the user wishes to combine this information with a map that informs the localization of the collected measures. Therefore, a single mashup application can compose such temperature and localization information. The application programming and execution model adopted by EcoDiF is based on the <a href="http://www.openmashup.org/omadocs/v1.0/index.html">Enterprise Mashup Markup Language (EMML)</a>, which is an open declarative language for developing Web mashup applications. In this perspective, mashup applications are implemented by using the EMML language and executed by using the <a href="http://www.openmashup.org/omadocs/v1.0/emml/oma-deploy-mashup.html">EMML Runtime Reference Engine</a>, which is an engine that processes the mashup scripts written in EMML. In addition, a scripting engine (embedded in the EMML Runtime Reference Engine) can be used for programming more complex applications that requires scripts written in other languages.
documentationUserProfiles=Given the features of its modules, EcoDiF envisions four profiles of stakeholders, namely: (i) <strong>device manufacturers</strong>, which develop drivers to their devices in order to make them compatible with the EcoDiF's API; (ii)	<strong>data providers</strong>, which are device owners that make the data produced by their devices available at EcoDiF through the specific drivers for each device; (iii) <strong>application developers</strong>, which build Web applications or services that take as inputs data (raw data provided by the connected devices or more refined data produced as output of other applications) available at EcoDiF or produced by any other Web accessible resource, for their business purposes, and; (iv) <strong>data consumers</strong>, which are users that interact with EcoDiF in order to consult information (about devices and provided data, applications, etc.) that is available at the platform.
